<b>FootNote App</b>

An app for creative writers who are often struck by inspiration whilst out and about.
The app will be comrpised of a network of members who work as creative writers in some form; e.g. a pool of like-minded creatives with similar interests who they can apply to give feedback on their quick ideas.

The ideas are anonymous but the associated FootNotes, which only those who can log in can view are attributed to the FootNoter (both who left the idea and when)

The is an approval tick beside the idea so users can signify their approval by clicking this.

Approval ticks are anonymous.

Users are not obliged to either tick the approval or to leave a FootNote. They can do neither, either or both if they wish. FootNotes have additional transparency incase they are overly negative, for moderatership purposes.

The idea with the app is that it will encourage free ideas without judgement.

It is not aiming at stealing people's intellectual property but at creative minds nudging each other in the right direction.


<b>Functionalities to include:</b>

Based on the Minimum Viable Product documentation on Project 4, I concluded that I would have to have the following functionalities available in my FootNote app:

<b>CRUD mentality</b>
Both the user and superuser/administrator of my FootNote application, should have the ability to Create, Read, Update and Delete items.

Albeit, this is applied in different ways.

-For the administrator/Superuser who regulates the FootNote profile, they will regulate what appears on their profile. They can create, read, update and delete their own original ideas (one idea at a time is the FootNote policy-to avoid oversaturation.) Also there is a maximum length of 100 words per original idea posted,to be inkeeping with the initial aim of the applicaiton, to post a fast idea that occurs to the profile owner whilst out and about in order to get immediate feedback (as opposed to exposing intiacte/vital parts of their original creative ideas.)
-The admin/Superuser will be able to view FootNotes posted by the users and to approve whether they appear on the app. 
-The admin/Superuser can delete ideas (and as a result, all of the footnotes posted to it will delete with the CASCADE effect)
-The admin/Superuser can approve selected FootNotes to their offline profile. They will be able to edit/update these FootNotes once they have been moved offline and are no longer visible on their public FootNote profile.
-The admin/Superuser can change the order of the FootNotes and ideas.

USER
-From the user perspective, their statistics on the site will accumulate from the moment they joined the application. The will stipulate their preferences (e.g. their favourite genre, their method of writing-e.g. poetry, novel, screenplay, song etc) and based on their specifications, suggested connections will pop up for them (similarly to the suggested followers function in instagram or the suggested friend section in facebook or the suggested connection section in LinkedIn). The can apply to become a feedback given on the profile of one of the suggested connections. Once they submit to become a feedback giver, the owner/admin/Superuser of the profile that they have applied to will assess whether or not to accept them as a feedback giver on their profile. This assessment will be made by the historical statistics of the applicants engagement-to-date on the FootNote App becoming readily visible to the profile owner. Metrics that will be exposed with the applicants statistics are when they joined the app, how many original ideas of their own have they posted, how many votes have they submitted to other peoples FootNote Profiles, what ratio green/red votes did they submit for other ideas, how many FootNotes did they leave what % of green votes did they leave FootNotes for (the user can only leave a footnote if they vote green). This will help the profile owner to make an informed decision about whether or not to accept them as a feedback giver on their profile. 

 Once user registers, they can then perform a variety of CRUD functionalities:
 -They can read the latest original idea posted/any number of ideas they want to
 -They can click on the green tick beneath an original idea to signify whetehr they believe should not pursue the original idea further/deserves more traction. 
 -The user can leave a FootNote on an idea, with a maximum length (to support the FootNote aim of providing concise helpful nods in the right direction as opposed to giving away intellectual property). 
 FUTURE FEATURE:-They can update or delete their FootNote at any point they want to (this will also be reflected in the statistics on their own profile). They can do this up until the point that they profile owner deletes the original idea (the FootNotes will disappear along with the original idea due to the CASCADE effect applied)
 FUTURE FEATURE:-They will be able to click like or unlike on FootNotes posted by other users

Fomr what perspective can members use the app?: I intend to apply this from both a user perspective and a supersuer perspective.

The app from the perspective of the superuser who is also the administrator and, as such, a regulator of the site will be able to log in and regulate the front end view of their profile. They will operate as an administator and readily be able to control what views and posts appear on their page. 

<b>What is it?:</b>
 The FootNote app is an app connecting creative people. It connects creative people whose art form is original writing of some sort, who want to share their original ideas and to get instant feedback from similarly minded people in useful footnote format, with a maximum amount of characters so that the contribution provided by other app users is a helpful nod as opposed to providing an idea to plagiarise. 
 
  The emphasis on transparency (Every footnote will be attributed to the footnote giver),  is in place to ensure that nobody abuses the app or tries to use it as a method of stealing the original thoughts of others/to offer unconstructive negative feedback. Equally the ideas left are anonymous so that the ideas are judged/assessed/reacted to exclusively from a creative perspective...the anonmymous nature of the idea itself guarantees unbiased footnotes will be provided.

FUTURE FEATURE
 Similarly to the preferences section of Tinder, upon joining the app, the FootNote member is presented with several questions, encouraging them to stipulate their area of interest, the genres they are interested in and writers they are similar to/inspired by and their form of writing (novel/songwriter/screenwriter/poet). Based on the preferences that they list, they will unlock a pool of other profiles that they can apply to be feedback givers on. The owners of the profiles they apply to be feedback givers to, will be able to see their site statistics (how much interaction they have had on the FootNote application (e.g. what ratio of green/red votes on other people's original ideas they have had, how many FootNotes they have posted as feedback to other people's profiles, how many original ideas have they posted to their own profile, when did they join the site etc.) The owner of the profile, who decides whether or not to accept the applicant as a feedback-giver on their own profile will be able to make an informed decision about whether to accept them or not based on their statistics. (e.g. if a profile owners sees that the member who has applied to be a feedback giver on their page, joined three years ago and has yet to post their own original thought and has voted 100% red on other people's original ideas without providing any Footnotes, the profile owner may not be inclined to accept them to their profile as the impression created is that they are there to steal ideas, to offer exclusively negative feedback and not to contribute anything themselves).

Everyone who joins the FootNote app has the choice of having their own FootNote profile, where they post their ideas and are susceptible to criticism/feedback by the other FootNote app members who they have accepted as feedback givers on their profile. Additionally, they will be capable of applying to be a feedback given on the profiles or other writers who they match with. They will need to be accepted as a feedback giver before they can see the ideas, vote the idea green/red and give feedback on the profiles of other FootNote members.

<b>DESIGN:</b>

Having used both Balsamiq and Lucidcharts for design at planning phase for apps in the past, I decided that Lucidcharts would be suitable for this project as the shapes and visual aspect to it would be able to convey my stream of thoughts but also to help me to priorise each step/task as I was completing it.

Agile methodology-apply the ROMDAS prioritisation...

As I was thinking about what features to add, I categoreised them as must have, nice to have etc.

The blog walkthrough and Kanban board feature assisted me in thinking about what features I would include in project four and how to go about implementing these/dividing these into sections that I could apply and what t to prioritise...

Inspired by the walkthrough projects (Djanjo to do app and blog), I planned on having the design for the model classes neatly planend and laid out in tabular format in a Lucidchart format, which would help me to formulae the idea in my own head when designing the code for the app:

<b>Model-View-Template</b>

<b>Model</b>
 ORM-Object relational mapping...contains essential fields of the data. Each model maps to a single table. Django contains implicit functionality, hiding the plumbing.

<b>View</b>
ontains logic, it is the controller of the app. Define the business logic that link templates and models.

<b>Template</b>
User interface. Presentation layer- how info is displayed to the user. Designer-friendly syntax for rendering information to be presented to user. Business logic separated from presentation logic. Only concerned with presentation of data and visual elements. Can't call python code directly within templates. Visually represent data model. Syntax decoupled from HTML. Designers assumed comfortable with HTML and Javascript code. Syntax embedded within HTML, used to inject data into webpage. Most common language=Django language.

Django...focus on implicit, hiding the plumbing (against usual Python approach of better to see something)

Offer enough functionality (branching and looping) to allow us to make gooey decisions.

Convention over configuration
Developer need only specify unconventional aspects
If stray from convention, explicit code needs to be added
Implicit functionality

Boilerplate code from walkthrough
Adding customisation
Adding some non conventional, specific code

As per the blog walkthrough, I used class-based views.
Allow us to use code that is reusable and that inherits from one another.
'Generic views' (built in Django feature) used, batteries included philosophy od Django.

-Medley view building...

1. Create view code

Employ generic view.

-Views.py file: 

a. Import generic library from django.views 
b. Import model that we will base views on (e.g. 'Medley' model as defined in models.py file)
c. Create a class. 


2. Create view template

Template-html templates. Structures what you see in the view. Foor loops, shape of images. Attribute classes that are designed by CSS.

3. Connect urls file

Add the wiring, ensure to import the correct items at the top of the page and the correct url and brackets are used


<b>Principles of Agile development, prioritisation</b>

Connectint cloudinary, using it for image storage and quick urls

Package=plugs into code already written (use as much/little as possible)
Django framework=code is already written, you plug your code into it...Provides basic structure, customize within reason

Routing between different templates to avoid duplicating/repeating code...extends %%
Base.html is the premise and other html files used, %% block quotes slotted into base.html file. Base.html file extended.

<b>Class Models</b>
Class-based models defined within models.py file and additional definitions included within those models.(specifications)

Two models derived closely from the blog walkthrough project but customised accordingly and tailored code to suit my project which were the 'idea' model and the 'footnote' model.

I added an additional functionality to the footnote model that a counter was attached to each idea and this was displayed under the idea, to show how many footnotes were received on a comment. Also placed exactly beside the likes so a nice visual comparison given for how many footnotes there were compared to how many likes there were.

Future features: Additional model for the person who owns the idea can soft-delete their idea and all corresponding footnotes at any time so that that the view becomes private and visible to only them...this will be a good way to ensure that the summary page doesn't become oversaturated.

Summary page, there will be a filter option inserted to order ideas either by how many green ticks they received or how many FootNotes they recieved.

The cascade delete effect is in place so once an idea is deleted, all accompanying footnotes will be deleted as well.

-Additional model for 'connect with my profile'...people who leave ideas will be able to set up a profile, containing only their ideas.
-Additional model 'Make this my favourite idea'...function of the FootNote website, users can choose one idea per per day as their favourite.

-Authentication-an additional future feature to be added is that only those who like the original idea will be able to leave a footnote-this will be to for website moderation purposes-the focus of the website is to focus on providing small nuggets of inspiration, a nod in the right direction as opposed to negative or frivolous vitriolic comments.

Max length 280 characters for both idea and footnotes as the focus of the website is on giving helpful nuggets on fast-occuring ideas as opposed to crossing the territory into elaborate collaboration/plagiarism.


-Pagination
Six idea summaries per page, then pagination comes into force.
This is so the user does not become overwhelmed.
It is an app designed to be used on a small, mobile device so visually, summary cards for six ideas seems most appropriate, to avoid unnecessary scrolling.
Once the idea card is clicked into, there will be one idea per page and up to ten footnotes. 


Idea Model:
FootNote Model:

Counter-select the green check mark, a counter is activated and this is visible also on the summary page so that users can quickly reference an idea that has received a lot of positive feedback and they might want to explore further.

Future feature: Users can vote approve/disprove of on idea
If they vote like only then will they be given the authentication to post a footnote



<p>Lucidcharts</p>

Luidcharts and it's easy-to-use shapes (circles, arrows), color scheme (to discern features/relationships from one another) and tabular format (enabling me to use spearate tabs for different views/drill downs into models etc) greatly assisted me in designing how I wanted the app to look.

The ability to use various shapes color coded-operated as a visual legend of sorts. The arrows also helped me to design on a chani of command.

I mapped various parts as 'One to Many Relationships' or 'Many to One' and colour coded them.

Order of events and priorisation easier to understand...chain of action

<b>Kanban board and user stories</b>

Agile methodology
Helped me to form logic
Logical progression
Easy way to focus on tasks that needed to be conpleted
Features I wanted to add

As I was progressing through the Kanban board of user stories, I bore in mind the prioritisation emphasised in the Agile methodology moduke:
I was always thinking about what is a must-have, what would be nice to have and what would be a feature added only if we had time.

<b>Views:</b>

Views-what views are there for this app:
-Summary view-shows a segment of a page containing the idea (summary of all ideas posted (6 ideas per page) and a counter function shows the amount of approvals with a tick and number). Shows amount of approvals associated with idea and the main image.(either the image uploaded with the original post or a default image)
-Idea and footnote view - 1 idea per page with up to ten footnotes. Allows focus to be on that idea. On this page, all users can see idea and footnotes left as well as number of approvals on ideas and number of smiley faces or unhappy faces on footnotes. They can also see when idea/footnotes were created/edited and by whom.
-Sign in/sign out/register tabs: Functional tabs that allows the user/potential user to sign in/sign out or register for the app
-Admin interface-The administrator logs in and can moderate the site. Can issue approvals etc.


Future features:
-Private view- a separate offline view for the idea owner. Can soft delete the idea at an point and due to CASCADE.DELETE function, all related footnotes will soft delete also. By soft delete, this means becomes private and visible only to the user who posted the original idea and not to the general users. Once hard deleted, the idea and all footnotes would be deleted from the app.
-View-bits of inspiration (things we liked). A separate view created by the moderator/adminstrator, showcases the most popular idea of the day and has a variety of quotes from writers and pictures of famous writers. It will also have a button called 'Inspire me'. This button will generate three random footnotes (of all of the hundreds of footnotes stored on the database for the apps) and post three of them at a time. One in each circular shaped bubble, to create a dream like effect. The footnotes will be deliberately without context and the randomness/incongruity/unrelatedness with one another may be humorous or profound and hopefully inspire the user.

User interaction
One to many relationship?
Or many to many relationship?

Functions to break down...

One to many-the profile owner operates as the superuser or administrator of their own profile. Only they can post/edit their own original idea on their own FootNote profile. Accordingly, this is a one to many relationship.

The users or feedback givers who are viewing the original ideas of the profile owner, who are voting like/dislike on the profile owners original ideas, who are posting FootNotes in response to the ideas (which have a maximum character/word restriction but can be deleted or edited by the user until the footnote is stored/removed by the profile owner) and who can like or dislike the footnotes of other users is a many to many relationship as they can interact on the profile but also they can receive interactions by others (such as somebody liking/disliking their footnote)


<b>Directories and frameworks used:</b>
Cloudinary
Django
Boostrap
Summernote


Design....
CSS (starter template used from blog project but how has this been adapted further)...hover..what frameworks have been connected that are aiding in bringing this app to fruition

Visibility


<b>Things to consider when compiling project</b>
-Order
-Frameworks to be installed (Django, Summernote, considered using Flask and reviewed a number of Bootstrap templates that I could have used)

-MVP-My focus was on keeping in line with the Minimum Viable Product (CRUD, Object orientated programming and object orientated programming (classes))

-Refactoring/inheritance (order of code, inheritance from parent code and using minimum amount of code/avoid repititon)
Excellent feature of Django-blocks of code that could easily be slotted into the base.html file.

-Test based coding (what tests were used)
MAKE SURE TO PUT IN TESTS...Write 1/2 original tests
Manual testing...testing for responsiveness...testing programmes


-Design based coding...app aimed a tmobile phones. Used developer tools to view the app from different mobile phones and ensured it was reponsive. (bootstrap flexbox, overscroll:hidden, vh and vw)

Was bootstrap used?
Yes-how did bootstrap assist...
the cards
considered using different templates-for exmaple the code within the 'creative' template on the bootstrap site

We used bootstrap for alert messages
Format we wrote bootstrap in...
What effect did this have on the project?

Object orientated design...class based models as opposed to function based models used


<b>Deployment:</b>

Early deployment as per the walkthroughs to avoid last minute panic.
Before writing the code, set up an instance on ElephantSQL and then created the app on Heroku. Used the API from ELlephant SQL to build Heroku APP. Connected Heroku with Github CLI for automatic deployment.

Help to avoid last minute disasters.

Importance of disable the DEBUG feature emphasised in tutorials as well as the importance of removing the DISABLE_STATICFILES.


<Challenges with deployment>
Surely enough, I had some difficulties, migration wouldn't work on my first attempt so I had to redo the entire applicaiton (repositary-Elephant SQL-Heroku app-migrate)

In the end, I believe migration would not work due to mixing up the use of app name versus project name in some of the code so I ensured to be very careful with this going forward.


I an into this issue again on the friday prior to finishing the project and as tutor assistence had signed off for the night, I redid entire app and project on Github/ElephantSQL and Heroku. All was well until I tried to deploy on Heroku and the build log revealed the buildpack wouldn't recognise any languages (e.g. python). I tried to tweak...but again believe issue may be app was created as 'footnote_final' on Gitpod but is named as 'footnotefinal' on Heorku as they won't allow underscores.

I checked in with my tutor the next day and after all of the rework, it was revealed the env.py file and installations needed to be redone due to me having opened the code using gitpod as opposed to the pinned workspaces platform. A lesson learned the hard way!

  A couple of tricks for this was i used the reveal config vars in Heroku to inform me what to input in my env.py file and I recursivrly installed the needed packages form the requirements.txt file using the following command:

  pip3 install -r requirements.txt

<b>UX DESIGN</b>

Focus on idea...
Mobile-first design, app is designed for those who are on the move, out and about and are struck by quick inspiration and want instant feedback so naturally, is designed to be used by users when they would be on their mobile phones. Accordingly, the app has been designed to be responsive to a number of different types of phone.

Sharp
Having done some research online, the font that I have chosen, 'Dancing Script' is inkeeping with the theme of creative writing, so chose as it looks like handwriting.

Use of superscript-in keeping with them theme, I used superscript in the titles. Visually appealing and on theme. <sup>FOOTNOTE</sup>

In my design, I wanted to convey the fast-moving and transient nature of what the app is intended for (quickly occurring spouts of creativity) so I used bright colors, quick messages/modals and various animations including...

Also to emphasize the 'by foot' or transient element, I used the color scheme of the title to spearate the Foot from the Note-Foot in purple, Note in black.

Colors used: Peachpuff and purple
Shape: Maintained the summary of cards from blog walkthrough, appreciated the visual
Use of opaque footpprint: Above masthead on summary page and in place of masthead on individual idea pages-inkeeping with the transient, on foot theme.
Font used: Dancing Script

Additional design feature: Use of Superscript

 Also the additional Medley app is purely for decoration, not adding functionality but there as a pool of inspiration, drawing for other areas of the app, designed to look like a dream bubble.

Footsteps...animation of footsteps moving across the screen

Creation in motion

Design-focused on smaller devices...phones/ipads/tablets/laptops while on the move-empahsis on responsiveness

Important to have one idea per page...to avoid oversaturtion.
Each idea given a separate page, footnotes unlimited but relevant to that idea only.

Background...

Animated background
Focus not on reading long pieces of narrative so background does not be to be dull

Vibrant colour

Animation and graphics

Loading bar

Hover effect for likes and dislikes...

Use of footnote superscript in the title (and dragging into the footnotes). 
To support the idea that users are contributing small tidbits of inspiration/nudges in the right direction, adding on to the idea like a footnote as opposed to offering major insights.


<b>FEATURES</b>

-Admin interface (moderation of site-deleting ideas and footnotes)

-Post idea-all users can see

-Logged in users can check the green tick to indicate they approve of the idea, a counter feature displays the amount of approvals on the summary card for each idea on the summary page


-If vote pursue idea, can leave a footnote...Footnotes are max length 280 characters-FootNote is posted, visible for other users to see. FootNotes appear under the idea on the idea page.

The purpose of the footnote is for users to give one sentence of constructive criticism on the idea. Each user can post as many footnotes as they want. The FootNote reveals who created the FootNote and when they created it.

-Superuser posts an idea. Max length 280 words, a quick idea that occurs to them while out and about. Once posted and polls have opened, they cannot edit the idea any more as this would create a false reflection on what had been voted for if others users had already voted. Superuser can only delete idea and when deleted all associated footnotes will delete with that idea.

-Users can like or dislike other footnotes as they please. They cannot comment on other footnotes. Footnotes have a max length and users can only post one footnote per idea to avoid oversaturation.

-Navigation bar. Summary page with summary cards for different ideas (revealing amount of likes/footnotes on an idea). Login/Logoff function. Register function. Medley tab, this is a decorative tab, to provide quick inspiration-quotes from famous writers and three circles in the shape of an idea bubble which generate random footnotes from the database.
-Tooltips

-Modal messages...how used

-Alert messages

-Counter on likes and counter on number of footnotes-can like without leaving a foonote, both reflected in the summar card on summary page

<b>Future features</b>
-Filter on FootNotes under idea for different users
-Order footnotes by amount of likes
-Order idea cards on summary page by most liked
-The main image that appears on the idea will be also uploaded by the app user, it will be connected to their mobile.

<b>TECHNOLOGIES USED</b>
-Summernote
-Django
-Crispy forms
-Cloudinary
-Python
-HTML
-CSS
-Different websites for images

When performing resarch, considered Flask also (particularly the CI Torin project)

<h1>TESTING</h1>

<p>Using the tutorials on testing from the To-Do app walkthrough, I ensured to follow those steps to test the files.</p>


Django has a testing framework-with automated tests.
Django is inbuilt with test.py file. Django imports testcase class-extension of Unittest (methods to assert things about code)
Testing is based on assertions. 
-Write classes within files to test various things within targeted files
Once class is written, run the test command:
-python3 manage.py test command run 
After command run, output will be printed to the terminal providing a summary of the following details of the test:

We see whether a test failed, coded as one of the following, '.','F' 'E'
. = passed test
F= failed test
E= Error detected

We see what test failed and why
We are provided with a Summary detailing: How many tests were run, how long it took and how many failures there were.

For the FootNote App, I tried to write specific tests to see whether the specific tests fail.

Firstly, split the 'test.py' file out into three separate files for more specified testing, clear code (organised and easy to manage, keeping tests independent of one another). I completed a select number of tests only due to limited time: 


(1)Test forms - split into test_forms.py file

<p>What was tested for forms</p>
Imported 'FootNoteForm' from forms.py file and django.test from TestCase
Wrote a class and included a test for form ensuring that FootNote form was not submitted blank.


(2)Test models - split into test_models.py file
<p>What was tested for models</p>
Test footnote will autmotically be false until approved by admin.


(3)Test views - split into test_views.py file
<p>What was tested for views</p>
-Get summary page
Tell it summary page-idea detail. Test uses HTTP response.
</p>

Once this was done, I performed a coverage test to see what % of the app had been tested

Coverage test:
.coverage file created.

<b>Manual Testing Write-Up</b>

Pagination-check could I move from page to page

Supposed to move to a new page when three idea summaries are on site, wrote six ideas to test this and sure enough three moved to a separate page.

Max ten footnotes per page...check this.

Click submit button, footnote submitted, message appears

Alert messages for login and logout

<b>Responsiveness testing:</b>

Flexbox...overscroll...bootstrap

CSS...
Justify-content center
flex
overflow:hidden

vh and vw used- sizes things relative to the viewport height(vh) and viewport width(vw)

Please see below, a variety of responsiveness testing photos on different viewports,
viewed online via Developer Tools:
Sample phots
On..Iphone 12
On..Nest
On..Ipad
On...Macbook Pro

Was anything cut off...was everything visible

Cards stack on top of one another in a responsive fashion instead of becoming stretched or crushed and the visibility is not affected by the size of the viewport

Ability to scroll down


<b>Compatibility testing</b>

Tested on various browsers

See below table with browser listed and detail on compatability

Google
Safari
Firefox
Internet Explorer

<b>Bugs resolved and unresolved</b>

...mark as we go

Opening from Github as opposed to pinned workspace...had to recreate env.py file a number of times.
Had to reinstall various dependencies...allauth, summernote etc.

-Used 'Hello Django' blog code as boilerplate code, had to get rid of author as author id not recognised.

Django, large useful error messages
Browser open as I coded, refreshed and received feedback into different types of errors and reasons for them


<b>Lighthouse testing outcomes</b>

<b>User stories testing</b>
As per the walkthrough, in support of Agile methodology, I set up a Kanban board to track what items I installed for the app.

Three categories:
To do, in progress, complete

Kanban board-completed as I completed coding. As I was progressing through the coding of the application, this helped me to logically prioritise and gave me immediate visual feedback as to what remained left to be done.

<b>Prioritisation:</b>

Focused on three categories of prioritisation:

<b>Need to have:</b>
CRUD functionality-administrator interface mainly
Can create also via footnotes as a user
Can create account with registration

-Admin interface
-Account registration
-Different views via navigation bar
-Users ability to submit footnotes for approval


<b>Maybe have</b>
-Counters to display number of ticks on an idea
-Counter to show how many footnotes left on an idea

<b>Nice to have</b>
-have mentioned future features
-Ability to like footnotes left

<b>Features testing</b>

-Post FootNote
-Counters reflect number of likes an idea received and how many FootNotes were left on an idea
-Summary cards open up more detail idea post when clicked
-Pagination works effectively
-Account regisation works
-Log in, log off works
-Messages work and disappear by themselves after specified time (6 seconds-6000)
-FootNotes give detail on who posted them and when they were posted
-Facebook/Tiktok/Instgram at bottom
-NAV bar effectively allows user to navigate from summary page to idea page

<b>Deployment, forking, cloning </b>
<b>Steps</b>
<b>On Github:</b>
Disable debug...get rid of traceback which my compromise your site
Install X-Frame Options=Same Origin...CORS cross origina resource sharing security feature
Waht resources are permitted to be loaded

<b>On Heroku</b>
Go to settings-Reveal Config Vars

Remove DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC config variable

Deploy tab, scroll to end, deploy branch

View build log to ensure all working okay

As per future features listed - still room for a lot of development

Django...not everything needs to be in one app
All app logic doesn't need to be in views.py file
